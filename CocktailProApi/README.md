My project is leveraging *free Json API* from [CocktailDB](https://thecocktaildb.com/), Creating a 
front end interface that allows the website visitor to do the following:
* Browse all the cocktails in the DB, sorted by letter.
* Get a random cocktail.
* Find out all the possible cocktails with a specific ingredient.
* Suggest to the webmaster any cocktail in particular to include.
